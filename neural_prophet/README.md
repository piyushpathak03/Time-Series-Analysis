# NeuralProphet
A Neural Network based Time-Series model, inspired by [Facebook Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) and [AR-Net](https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net), built on PyTorch.

For a visual introduction to NeuralProphet, view the [presentation given at the 40th International Symposium on Forecasting (Oct 26, 2020)](notes/Presented_at_International_Symposium_on_Forecasting.pdf).

## Documentation
A proper [documentation page](https://ourownstory.github.io/neural_prophet/) is in the works.

## User Install
After downloading the code repository (via `git clone`), change to the repository directory (`cd neural_prophet`) and install neuralprophet as python package with
`pip install .`

Note: If you plan to use the package in a Jupyter notebook, it is recommended to install the 'live' package version with `pip install .[live]`.
This will allow you to enable `plot_live_loss` in the `train` function to get a live plot of train (and validation) loss.

Now you can use NeuralProphet in your code:
```python
from neuralprophet import NeuralProphet
model = NeuralProphet()
```

## Model Features
* Autocorrelation modelling through AR-Net
* Piecewise linear trend
* Fourier term Seasonality at different periods such as yearly, daily, weekly, hourly.
* Lagged regressors
* Future regressors
* Holidays & special events
* Sparsity of coefficients through regularization
* Plotting for forecast components, model coefficients as well as final forecasts

## Contribute
### Dev Install
After downloading the code repository (via `git clone`), change to the repository directory (`cd neural_prophet`), activate your virtual environment, and install neuralprophet as python package with
`pip install -e .[dev]`

(Including the optional `-e` flag will install neuralprophet in "editable" mode, meaning that instead of copying the files into your virtual environment, a symlink will be created to the files where they are.)

Additionally you must run `$ neuralprophet_dev_setup` in your console to run the dev-setup script which installs appropriate git hooks for testing etc.

### Notes
We deploy Black, the uncompromising code formatter, so there is no need to worry about style. Beyond that, where reasonable, for example for doicstrings, we follow the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

As for Git practices, please follow the steps described at [Swiss Cheese](https://github.com/ourownstory/swiss-cheese/blob/master/git_best_practices.md) for how to git-rebase-squash when working on a forked repo.
